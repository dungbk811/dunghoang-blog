# Admin Authentication
# Password to access /admin panel

# Secret key for signing JWT tokens (admin session cookies)
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
# Keep this secret! Different for each environment
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-for-jwt-tokens-here

# GitHub Integration (for production deployment)
# Enables admin panel to commit changes directly to GitHub
# Create a Personal Access Token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required permissions: repo (Full control of private repositories)

# How it works:
# - Local development: Files are written to local filesystem
# - Production (Vercel): Changes are committed to GitHub → triggers auto-deployment
# - Without GITHUB_TOKEN: Admin edits work locally but won't persist on production
